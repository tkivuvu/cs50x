            Hi my name is Thibault Kivuvu, online student for CS50's Introduction to Computer
            Science course. I have created this website in accordance with problem set 8
            "Homepage". On this webpage I will be showcasing one of my favorite hobbies which is
            watching, interacting with, and commenting on mainstream sports. My focus will be
            european soccer and NBA basketball, my two favorite sports and leagues, there will
            also be a broader focus on other mainstream sports on my sports quiz page.

            One last point, this is all subjective and in no way is this meant to be anything other than that,
            these are simply my own personal favorites which, in some cases, may not be the same way others see it.
