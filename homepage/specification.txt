How I used JavaScript and Bootstrap:
The way in which I used JavaScript was to create some logic as to how I would
program a sports quiz this can be found in my sportsquiz.html as for bootstrap
I used it to create my dropdown menu as well as my tables that are seen in
eusoccer.html and nbabasketball.html.
