# CS50x – Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my solutions to problem sets and the final project from Harvard University's CS50x — an intensive introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

## 🏗 Course Overview

CS50x introduces foundational concepts in computer science and programming through languages like C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript. Topics include:

- Algorithms and data structures
- Memory management
- Web development
- Cybersecurity
- Abstraction and computational thinking

## 📁 Project Structure

### Problem Sets

| PSet | Topic            | Description                                    |
|------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Scratch          | Visual programming with Scratch                |
| 1    | C Basics         | Hello, Mario, Cash, Credit                     |
| 2    | Arrays           | Readability, Substitution, Caesar cipher       |
| 3    | Algorithms       | Sorting and searching, Plurality/Runoff vote   |
| 4    | Memory           | Recovering JPEGs, Filter (BMP image editing)   |
| 5    | Data Structures  | Speller using a hash table and dictionary      |
| 6    | Python           | Sentimental CS50 (converting to Python)        |
| 7    | SQL              | Querying SQLite databases (e.g. Fiftyville)    |
| 8    | HTML, CSS, JS    | Homepage with front-end web design             |
| 9    | Flask            | Finance app using Flask & SQLite               |

> 📌 Note: The `movies.db` file from PSet 7 was excluded due to GitHub’s file size limit (100MB+). However, `fiftyville.db` and query files are included and demonstrate similar SQL work.

### 🏀 Final Project: NBA Stats Hub

**Project Title**: *NBA Stats Hub*  
**Description**: A web application I designed and built using **Flask**, **JavaScript**, and **SQL**. It allows users to retrieve and explore NBA player statistics from a public API. Features include:

- Graphical analysis (charts & visualizations)
- Dynamic stat summaries
- Player search and filtering
- Team logo integration

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Low-level memory management with C
- Building full-stack web apps with Flask
- Designing efficient algorithms
- Writing secure, readable, and well-documented code
- Real-world application of SQL for data analysis
