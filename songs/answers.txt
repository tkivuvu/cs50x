So in terms of danceability if this database was that of one
listener's top 100 songs the avg is 0.716 so more danceable than not
in terms of energy the result is 0.659 so relatively energetic
and valence is 0.484 so this is neutral so not very happy or very sad.

this might not be very representative because it is an average and averages
have many flaws including extreme values or skewed data and in this case
we can use mode or median for better representation or we could use
the genre of music the person likes maybe.
