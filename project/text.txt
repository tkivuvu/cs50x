still lots to do but will need to look carefully at the API so as to avoid using the
wrong or unnecessary data, still need to look at what i have just added namely
using id as a unique identifier primary key that is in order to find specific data
the point here is that looking at the API's data structure each ID value is the
identifier for lets say for e.g 2023 lebron stats or 2021 kyrie stats each of these
has its own id and this is what seperates them best not season or even player names
the thing that is consistent (for each player as opposed to each data point) is
playerId this seems to be the same throughout and should be used as the unique
identifier above all else and for the simple id value this is in regards to which data
you are looking at as a whole meaning for e.g is this playerdatatotals or
playerdataadvanced or PlayerDataAdvancedPlayoffs etc..


04.10
another thing ive realised and will have to account for with conditionals in my flask app
is that when a player appears more than once in data totals its because they moved teams
during the year and therefore their full stats are where team:"TOT" column in the
API dataset appears so whenever this supposed TOT team which isnt a team at all but rather
i believe means totals meaning for all the teams they have played for that year


04.11
now that i have the API i want and i am able to retrieve the info cache it and use it
as i please i need to figure out how i would like to structure my website. this means
what would i like to put on my index page for e.g how many pages will i have what will
these pages contain? will i create a login requirement if so for what exactly remember
the finance one was due to the fact that this is a personal account handling the purchase
and selling of stocks so it made sense, i cant create something like that if it is not needed
will need to check with the AI if this is something that would be useful for the purpose
of the website i am creating because there is still quite a lot to do including finding all the
right stats which to use and how and also finding the charts and how that whole thing works
i.e chart creation.. will need to go back to the top of my AI queries and see what were the
suggestions as it pertains to what i should include on the website


04.12
i am not going to do the users thing for now because there is no reason for it just yet what
i should be doing is looking at the stats and figuring out which i would like to use and then
proceed one by one implementing the html and helpers.py retrieval process from the API. starting
with the stats i already have i can proceed for today with implementing the table that will
contain these stats but where and how would i like to make the request from index page or have a
button on the index page that takes me to this other page that will then be where i make the
request for the stats and also show them on that same page? or create another one that will
send me there once i click on the search from there.

will also need to structure my data appropriately the best way to seach for a player's stats
in playerdatatotals for example is using the playerID this the unique ID each player has and
seems to be consistent throughout also remember again that if a player has team: "TOT" this means
that they have played for more than one team and this tot represents the totality of their stats
instead of any one statsheet that says what the team is- which in contrast represents just the
stats on that specific team that year

here is what cs50AI says about primary keys:
Choosing a primary key is an important decision in database design. A primary key should uniquely
identify each record in a table. In your case, if each player has a unique playerID, that would
be a good choice for a primary key.
If playerID is not unique, you might need to create a composite key using multiple fields, or
generate a new unique identifier for each record.

also tomorrow around 2.44p check if the stats from today have been removed
because i am not sure the deletion of the older query is being adhered to

04.13
my homepage should explain what this website is about and not necessarily have any seaching options
because this should probably just be buttons that lead to those pages that you can then look stats
up at, or if this is where i want people to search from that is also fine but i will have to separate
each query and thus have a form

will need to figure out a logic that when i want to display a player that has played
for multiple teams in any one year you can see stats for each team instead of just tot as
the team name but maybe saying something like played for nyk, tor etc and then the stats

also the url for the joakim meme is here: https://i.imgur.com/ibPry8m.jpeg

4.16
i now have most (if not all) of the necessary logic and programming to retrieve and cache the
necessary data from the API, the thing to do next is to try and figure out what i would like
my website to actually look like this seems small but will be big i might start from scratch
since i dont love what it looks like right now and although i might never love it this doesnt
matter what matters is its functionality smoothness etc i want a user to be able to use it in way
that makes sense to them where the data is in its right place etc...

4.18
the way in which the website will look:
- layout should consider removing the player search
- the player search should instead be put where each stat section is in the way in which
we did for quote and quoted in finance program so for each data type (e.g advanced playoff stats)
rather than searching at the index
- do i wanna also look at ways in which to maybe show each stats for a player that
has moved teams meaning og or luka moved in 2024 then it should show here are the stats
for dallas then here are for lakers and here they are combined?
- the stats from totals and anything before the playoffs does save all three of json format
stats meaning for e.g luka's stats are saved from dallas and LA and total as "2tm" for the value
to the "team" key
- maybe put in logic like- if a player has more than 1 team then combine the numbers and do such and
such, or show the stats for each meaning total, former team, current team (current team remember -- it
seems -- cannot be the first stats json, it is either the 2nd or 3rd stat sheet see examples: Zach
LaVine, Luka Dončić, jimmy butler)
- sidenote ftr means freethrow rate and it is the percentage of your field goals that are freethrows
calculated as fta/fga

4.19
- for the advanced stats function and template look up what the most important advanced stats are
and what they mean, display those (also maybe add all of the other stats with the click of a button
like i have been doing that show all of the stats and not just these few ones i have picked even for
the previous template namely player_totals.html)
- first finish all of the templates before thinking about the graphs and such and what those might look
like (already thinking maybe show graphs of each player for their carreer? maybe using like win shares or
some stat that best shows the progression of a player through the years?)


4.22
- now that all of the API requests are complete and the templates that are used to show that data, I can
begin thinking about what should come next but also refining my templates first and foremost.
- this refining will involve figuring out the aesthetics of my page, what do i want to show should i look
to show all of the stats maybe hidden under a clickable button? this may be best so as to avoid having too
much information unprompted therefore probably best to show the most important stats or those that seem to
be for me atleast and then hide behind the button the rest of the data if the user chooses to view them
will be up to them.
- then i can start to think of the graphs? what would they look like and most importantly what
would they be telling me? (look above previous paragraph for more on this)
- also what to do with the players search thing? is it necessary? it looks nice but what is its usefulness?
maybe i could make it so that when someone search a player i give them all of the stats for all four API
queries/functions but only for the current year we are in? so e.g if a user search for luka doncic i should
provide them with all of the stats that i have for the current year (hmm or maybe the previous since the API
does not seem to be updating curent playoff numbers in a timely manner)

4.23
- I will need to add logic that says if a player has an asteriks* at the end of their name in the playerName
column then it means they are in the hall of fame (Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame)

4.30
- special case for Dennis Schröder who has had 3 diff teams in a year so see how to make that work and
how it can look like the rest

5.1
- will need to add inside of totals stats the attempts as well as i am putting for e.g avg fg but not saying
this is only made attempts and also not specifying the attempts themselves this should be done for overall
FG, 2pt FG, 3pt FG, and FTs
- also for both playoff totals and advanced playoff stats which or the two i still have to finish you can copy
most of the logic from regular season stats just always remebering a player can only play for one team in the
playoffs 

5.7
- fix the null thing for Tim Duncan 2011 playoff lookup? (causing a internal server error due to value for
3pt percentage being equal to null and thus the compute in my logic does not pass) 

5.8
- when it comes to generating charts this sounds great in theory but what would they entail? they should be 
pretty informative when it comes to 

5.12
- maybe one last chart/graph, a pie chart that compares shooting splits between 2pt, 3pt and ft?

6.4
- add a collage of players in the blue navigation area in the layout 

6.5
- nav background- maybe a line of all team logos going around the nav bar 

6.16
- tomorrow finish the readme.md file for the app.py summary, overall final version of it all and then 
for helpers.py cleanup the code with comments and the like if necessary

6.17
- not too much left just getting a summary of the templates and accompanying css styling then finally
the video which i should first thoroughly understand all that my code contains before creating it the 
overall summary of everything will be more than enough of a template to base my explanations on
