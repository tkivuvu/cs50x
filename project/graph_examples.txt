1. Player Efficiency Over Time (Line Chart)
    What it shows: Trends in key stats (e.g., points, assists, rebounds) over seasons/games.

    Why it matters: Identifies improvement, decline, or consistency (e.g., "LeBron’s scoring dipped in 2021 but 
    rebounding improved").

    Example metrics:

    Points per game (PPG)

    Assists per game (APG)

    Player Efficiency Rating (PER) over time.

2. Shot Chart (Heatmap or Scatter Plot)
    What it shows: Shooting accuracy from different court locations.

    Why it matters: Reveals a player’s "hot zones" and weaknesses (e.g., "Steph Curry dominates from beyond the arc").

    Data needed:

    Shot coordinates (x/y positions from NBA API).

    FG% by zone (restricted area, mid-range, 3PT).

3. Player Comparison (Radar/Spider Chart)
    What it shows: Multi-stat comparison between two players (e.g., scoring, defense, playmaking).

    Why it matters: Highlights strengths/weaknesses in a head-to-head format.

    Example stats:

    PPG, APG, RPG, STL, BLK, FG%.

    Advanced stats (PER, Win Shares, Usage Rate).

4. Shooting Splits (Pie/Bar Chart)
    What it shows: Distribution of shot types (e.g., 3PT, mid-range, dunks).

    Why it matters: Shows playstyle (e.g., "Giannis relies on paint scoring").

    Data needed:

    2PT vs. 3PT attempts.

    Free throw frequency.

5. Advanced Metrics Dashboard (Bar/Line Charts)
    What it shows: Advanced analytics like:

    PER (Player Efficiency Rating): Overall contribution.

    TS% (True Shooting): Scoring efficiency.

    BPM (Box Plus-Minus): Impact vs. league average.

    Win Shares: Contribution to team wins.

    Why it matters: Quantifies value beyond basic stats.

6. Game Log Performance (Scatter Plot/Line Graph)
    What it shows: Consistency across games (e.g., points scored each game in a season).

    Why it matters: Identifies volatility (e.g., "Player X has 30+ points in 70% of games").

7. Defensive Impact (Bar Chart/Heatmap)
    What it shows: Defensive stats like steals, blocks, and defensive rating.

    Why it matters: Highlights defensive specialists (e.g., "Rudy Gobert’s rim protection reduces opponent FG% by 15%").

8. Playmaking Distribution (Donut Chart)
    What it shows: Assist distribution to teammates (e.g., "Jokic feeds MPJ 25% of his assists").

    Why it matters: Shows chemistry and playmaking focus.

9. Plus/Minus Impact (Line Chart)
    What it shows: Team performance when the player is on/off the court.

    Why it matters: Measures overall impact (e.g., "Warriors outscore opponents by +12 with Curry").

10. Player Archetype (Bubble Chart)
    What it shows: Clusters players by playstyle (e.g., "Scorer", "3&D", "Playmaker").

    Axes: Usage Rate vs. 3PT% vs. Assist Ratio.

Tools to Implement:
    D3.js: Highly customizable for complex visualizations (shot charts, heatmaps).

    Chart.js/Plotly: Simpler for bar/line charts.

    Python Libraries (if preprocessing data): Matplotlib, Seaborn.

    NBA API Data: Use endpoints like shotchartdetail for shot locations.

Tips for Design:
    Add tooltips for granular data (e.g., exact FG% on hover).

    Allow filters (e.g., by season, opponent, game type).

    Use responsive charts for mobile users.
