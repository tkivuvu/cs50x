It looks like you're off to a good start! You're correctly opening the file and reading
it in chunks of 512 bytes.

Here are a few questions to help guide you further:

1. How do you plan to identify the start of a new JPEG file?
2. What will you do once you identify the start of a new JPEG file?
3. How will you handle writing the recovered JPEG files to disk?

Think about these steps and try to implement them one by one. Let me know if you have
specific questions about any of these steps!


before doing the below remember to maybe also ask if you should create some for loop
that will handle the naming of the files with sprintf or if that is unnecessary
question:
would this be a good place to allocate memory to a string which will be the
name of the files?
Answer:
Yes, this would be a good place to allocate memory for the filename string. You can use
sprintf to format the filename. How do you think you can use sprintf to create filenames
like 000.jpg, 001.jpg, etc.?
